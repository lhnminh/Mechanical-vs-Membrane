Evaluating the effect of different types of keyboards on users' typing speed

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of different types of keyboards on the usersâ€™ typing speed, which was measured in Words Per Minute (WPM). The test was conducted using two different keyboards: Mechanical Keyboards (NK65 with NK Blueberry switches) and Membrane Keyboard (XPS 13 2020 keyboard). 50 observations were collected for each keyboard and are later compared to see if there is a significant difference between the typing speed. We found that there was no significant difference in mean WPM for mechanical keyboard and membrane keyboard (p-value = 0.191)
